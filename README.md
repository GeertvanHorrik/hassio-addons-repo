# About

I created this repo to store the addons I use and/or created myself. The primary reason was a broken update of OpenZWave (see https://github.com/home-assistant/hassio-addons/issues/1582) with no option to downgrade.

## Installation

Adding this add-ons repository to your Home Assistant supervisor is pretty easy. Follow the official instructions on the website of Home Assistant, and use the following URL:
